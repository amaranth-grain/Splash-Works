# Splash-Works
Term Project -- Resource Management Game as Web App (May 2018)

#Prompt
The City of Vancouver tasked our team with designing a web app that would either encourage waste reduction or water conservation.

#Proposed Solution
We decided to engage a younger audience and teach them about water conservation.  It is easier to change the habits of children / adolescents, and our aim was to educate them in a fun, engaging way.

Art is an alien who wants to terraform different planets.  As water is scarce, Art must manage water consumption to successfully complete the project.
